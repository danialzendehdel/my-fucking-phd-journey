## Introduction to Monte Carlo (MC) Methods
Monte Carlo (MC) methods are a foundational model-free approach in reinforcement learning (RL) for estimating the value function of a given policy. The model-free nature of MC is important because it means that MC methods do not require prior knowledge of the environment's transition dynamics or reward structure, unlike **Dynamic Programming (DP)** methods. Instead, MC relies on empirical data, directly sampling episodes from the environment to estimate state or state-action values.

In this post, we will answer common questions about MC methods, including how they work, how they differ from Temporal Difference (TD) and Dynamic Programming (DP) methods, and why they are model-free. Weâ€™ll focus on the characteristics of MC methods, including bias, variance, and bootstrapping, which often cause confusion.

## Key Concepts in Monte Carlo Methods

1. **Episode-Based Learning**:
   - Monte Carlo methods learn by running **complete episodes**, which are sequences of states, actions, and rewards that naturally end (e.g., reaching a terminal state in a game or a defined cutoff point).
   - By observing the cumulative return over an entire episode, MC methods avoid bootstrapping and rely on actual returns rather than estimated future rewards, which differentiates MC from TD methods.

2. **Calculating the Return**:
   - For each episode, the **return \( G_t \)** at a particular time step \( t \) is calculated as:
     \[
     G_t = R_{t+1} + \gamma R_{t+2} + \gamma^2 R_{t+3} + \dots + \gamma^{T-t-1} R_T
     \]
   - This return reflects the **actual cumulative reward** observed from the state at time \( t \) to the end of the episode. It is unbiased because it represents the real reward sequence under the current policy, without relying on any model.

3. **Handling States Visited Multiple Times**:
   - **First-Visit MC**: Only the first occurrence of each state in an episode contributes to the value function update. This approach reduces computation but still converges to the correct estimate over time.
   - **Every-Visit MC**: Updates the value function for each occurrence of a state in an episode. This method averages returns over multiple occurrences, providing a more data-rich update but with potentially higher variance.
